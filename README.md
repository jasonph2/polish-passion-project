# polish-passion-project

Right now this project is being broken down into three phases (I am currently on phase 1):
1. Develop features so that the user can speak into a microphone and have language of fluency matched with the language they do not know. The flow would be something along these lines:
     User selects add word => speaks word in Polish into mic and corresponding word in English into mic => User selects familiarity level with this word
   In addition, I hope then for the user to be able to have a custom recording of the words that they are working on in variable length:
      User clicks create recording => User selects length of recording => A recording is generated with a mix of words in varying order with both English to Polish and vice versa. => User can then use this recording to practice target language
2. Develop a feature to integrate artificial intelligence and text to speech so that the user may have more interactions within the recording that would be closer to real-life scenarios combining both words they know or a train-of-thought in language
     of fluency in which the user responds with the Polish that they know.
3. Expand app to be more universal in use and to not have to be utilized within an IDE using relative file paths in a local database.

This order of priority is a reflection on the inspiration for this project.

I am currently working on this project to be able to improve the following skills:
1. My Polish dialogue, as my wife's family is Polish I am unable to communicate with them and desire to be able to improve my communication ability.
2. Full stack development using React and Flask. I have had previous experience with this stack, but hope to solidify my skills through this project.
3. Database management
